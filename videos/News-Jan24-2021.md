# Actualización de Decred, 24 de enero del 2021. v1.6 inminente, Decred Eco, Métricas Altas, Propuestas y ¡Nuevo Contenido!

Hola y bienvenidos a otro video sobre las actualizaciónes de Decred.

We are on the brink of decred's biggest release in years, the 1.6 release.
 
This release will bring about privacy, the lightning network and it will decentralize the Decred treasury, making Decred on of the biggest decentralized autonomous organizations in crypto.
 
The treasury as of this video is worh about 37 million dollars and increasing by the day in this bull market.
 
We are also seeing highest stake participation ever seen in the project with over 55 percent of Decred staked in the decred proof-of-work proof of stake mining system.
 
 
The fact that so much Decred is being staked while we are in a bull run, just shows how  much confidence there is in the protocol and with that said let's move on to development updates.
 
Decred dcrd release cadidate version 5 is here for testing.
 
This release candidate mainly has under the hood improvements fixing various bugs and other dicovered oddities as well as general polishing. In the privacy tab users can now send all available funds from their default account to unmixed account by pressing a newly added button. This make de process of mixing your Decred even easier.
 
The what's new sections of the Decrediton also has been updated to show the 1.6 features.
 
Wallet translations have also been updated.
 
User can now turn off UI animations to make the wallet much more snappy when changing between tabs.
 
Decred developer Marco Peereboom says ther is more on the way for 2021 with two exciting things planned for this year.

Remember Decred has the ability to change his consensus code via stakeholder vote and the project treasury to fund new development things will be built and added to Decred not just in the next year but in the decades to come with the treasury increasing so much in value I hope this attracts outside developer talent and we can start seeing more and more proposals on Politeia.

A development pre-proposal from dex developer buck has arrived called Decred Eco, a gui application manager for Decred. The goal for Decred Eco is to be a one-stop Decred application manager wich automatically stays the date it allows users to launch Decred applications such as Decred Wallet Decrediton, The DEX and other Decred Software such as ticket splitting. Other apps can be expected as The Decred Project is constantly growing and expanding.

Imagine a Decred based version of the popular gaming platform steam. Where all of your apps are constantly updated and ready to launch with minimal user tinkering. Bucks is a working  prototype is done for linux and windows is in process.

The timeline and costs are 9 to 12 months until completion and an ask of 59 800 dollars. I will leave a link in the video description for those who want to read more about Decred Eco.

Taking a look at privacy stats over 29 percent of Decred in circulation has been actively mixed. Tha’s over 3.5 million Decred and release 1.6 has not even arrived yet.

Speaking of privacy, Edward Snowden was againg talking about Bitcoin’s lack of privacy features despite being in existence for 11 years.


Unfortunately the Bitcoin network as it exists does not provide the privacy protections really necessary for these kind of transactions at scale and I think It should and It could and it’s clear to me the developers relize this should be done for whatever reason however when we’re talking about Bitcoin improvement for rason they haven’t actually moved to do this wich is puzzling to me because  now they’ve had years to do it. I’m not picking winners and losers. I don’t have horse or care or concern as to who wins this beyond. I think what the world needs what we need is a truly independent means of enabling private transactions. My big question is Why are you guys taking so long?


Edwar Snowden wants to hold money that is both updradable and has privacy features. He should probably look into Decred.

We also saw lots of community activity in the form of podcasts and Videos.


I went in there and just did my standar scan through all of the on-chain metrics and basically everything was an all-time high right, transaction volume, staking volume, amount stake, coin mixing in a day, obviosly the DEX and LN are going to be at all-time highs. I was looking there’s on-chain metrics for Decred that are all time high. Left-right center it’s actually very impressive so even I was taken a back by the manitude of it you know you were looking for that stakeholders ticket buying. Well we cerainly got it. And i mean it’s crazy right like the percentage of supply in the ticket pool now is at all-time highs and you know what’s insane about all this is that all these all-time highs are getting pushed from an on-chain perspective wich is just you know larger stakeholder participation and you know natural bullishness on you know the DCR token is that this is al happening before 1.6 is even out. The owning absolute stake in the Decred DAO and the DCR of viability becoming some sort of monetary asset. You know it has legs let’s see what hapens in this bull market through right and I’m fairly sure that in the next release 1.7 wich you know this is the great thing about Decred right 1.6 hasn´t even come out yet. There’s already work going on at 1.7 and know on of the things that’s going to come into the wallets is going to be really clean multi-sign and multi-sign ultimately is the backbone and really what makes utxo chains very very different from you know traditional money, is you can have these elegant and unique custody solutions and what’s so fascinating about the on-chain space is essentially you get to see nino i love your saying about saying it’s the objective truth it just is what happened on the ledger  and the great thing about what happens in the ledger is that it’s really really expensive right. Every single print wheter it’s a difficulty adjustment whether it’s a hash whether it’s a transaction whatever it is right coin age coins not being spent coins being spent . All of those things are very very deliberate actions if you weren’t looking at the google search trends if you weren’t looking at the traditional media if you weren’t listening to the guys just know drawing fancy pictures on charts you’re actually looking at the data like checkmate and nino are doing. You would have seen the indicator telling you everything you needed to know and that’s what on-chain analysis is it is and evolution of what this base we needs in terms of analysis.


Decred contributor checkmate has released an amazing Decred walkthrough. So what Decred did with governance rather than the rough consensus model wich is essentially where it’s a mexican standoff you’ve got the miners, the users, the conomic nodes and the developers all arguming on twitter and yelling at each other on github trying to work out what the code is and the estadar approach for rough consensus is no change unless there’s global consensus and what that means is generally a much longer mush slower. Far more challenging and there is a lot of risk involving in rolling out network upgrades and they tend to take many many years not only for the debate and the discussion phase but then actually implement so there’s a long time layer to all of this. The main reason that i think it’s important to ve looking at Decred right now is Decred 1.6 wich is really the probably the biggest upgrade in Decred’s history is just on the horizon.

The community has lovingly named this thing hidden hydra because the hidden side is it captures the privacy element that’s coming in and the hydra is that it’s going to essentially give degrade multiple heads and make it an unstoppabble down.

The Decred Project Lead Jake Yocom-Piatt was featured on cointelegraph talking about the possible effects of a central bank digital currency takeover he says cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and decred are fundamentally fairer systems than fiat currencies so while cbdc’s may adopt any cryptocurrency features that cannot compete on fairness this is due to cyptocurrencies haing deterministic issuance schedules and self-custodians assets whereas cbdc’s are just digital fiat.

Decred arabia created an excellent educational video explaining decred’s hybrid consensus system. The Decred arabia team has a proposal out to continue funding future work more on that later in this video.

Staked Podcast was very active producing new episodes. Eduardo even has a proposal out more on that later in the video 


what was it about you know Decred over the hundred and thousands of others that you saw as this one could be worh holding for a decade.



If you actually try to start using bitcoin you know it’s got problems it’s got problems that actually make it unusable to me i don’t want the person i’m sending to be able to dig into my past transactions as just a deal breaker. Just because it was the first i’m really pretty sure that it’s not gonna be the one i think these problems that it’s got are gonna kill it there was nothing close to Decred having the potential to actually cover all of those things, the government things that we all known. Yeah, yeah, yeah the team and the incentive alignments. How do you come to? You know the ability to the ability to change the ability to adapt and the speed and having a governance to just see through those changes and the that’s it. Decred is not perfectly today  but it’s moving in that direction of being unruggable.


As interest and decred climbs in this bull market. Decred was the number three traded coin on the brazilian exchange Novodax after bitcoin and Ethereum.

Politeia Decred’s public proposal system has a few new proposals up for discussion and vote. The Decred DEX development phase 2 proposal from chappjc is here. Phase one of dex deveolpment saw the completion and release of a minimal viable product version of the dex wich has executed tens  of thousands of dcr worth of trades via atomic swaps with no middlemen, no kyc requirements and no trading fees. 
Phase 2 sets forth some well sought after objectives such as smoother onboarding via the use of simplified payment verification wich will enable quick startups and greatly reduce disk space usage since users will need to have full nodes to operate the DEX. The Decrediton integration efforts to get the DEX added into Decred’s main wallet and support for more assets namely ethereum and it’s erc 20 token standar wich would make trading popular stablecoin such as usdc and therer possible, bitcoin cash and other bitcoin forks will likely be added as well as they don’t require too much development time. 
Other work for this proposal includes continued under the hood bug fixes ui updates and other product improvement as time passes. Chappjs says the expected delivery for these developments is 6 to 9 months with work split between three to four full time developers. The total estimated cost is 245 000 USD dollar payable on Decred and billed monthly via Decred Contractor Management System. Certain initiatives that did not make the cut for this proposal but could see work in the future are Monero swap compatibility, Lightning Network integration and a server mesh wich would bring decentralization to the next level all in all the comments were enthusiastic about the dex release and the upcoming improvements proposed. One commenter writes with the tighter kyc requirements and clamp down on privacy oriented coins. This proposal could not come at a better time. The community appreciates and understands how important it is to be able to buy and sell Decred in a permissionaless and truly decentralized manner.

The next proposal is Decred in Depth (Live) from Eduardo Lima. Eduardo is taking the reins from mr black and starting up a new season of Decred in depth. The decred’s informative podcast series. He says he will livestream 24 to 36 episodies with each episode post-produced and turned into a podcast. Furthermore he will pull several smaller clips from the podcast in order to spread teasers on twitter and other social media sites. He’s asking 500 usd dollars per episode to be completed over the course of 2021.

He says the episodes will be live stream for viewers to tine in as the podcast is happening then later edited and uploaded to various platforms. Eduardo has been hosting his own decred focus podcast called staked over the past four months having a number of different guests on a talk Decred in Cryptocurrencies in general. Commenters have been positive about the proposal pointing out how importante the Decred in Depth serias has been for marketing and Eduardo’s commitment for The Decred Project having already produced four months worth of content. 
Some concerns were mainly bases on the format and the production quality. Eduardo says he will be handling Decred in Depth more professionalism as compared to the Staked Podcast wich is more free form.

Decred stakeholders can vote directly from their wallet by going to the governance tab.

A new proposal from amarooni titled “Decentralized Credits: The digitization of Money and Stake (book)" has arrived. Ammarooni plans to author a book based on his studies of Decred and economic context. Phase one of his work involved researching the Decred protocol followed by a series of written articles wich have become quite popular within the Decred community. 
His focus now is to study Decred as a monetary asset and as a dow. His research articles will ultimately be published as a free book made a available in pdf form as well as amazon kindle. Ammarooni argues one of the key reasons bitcoin is so successful is because of the amount of education material that draws people into the rabbit hole. Decred has a more complex design that bitcoin yet we have a only a teeny fraction of the amount of education material. He is asking for a maximum billing rate of two thousand dollars per month payable in Decred over a eight to ten month period and fifteen hundred dollars for finalization and publishing finzalized book once completed.
 Commenters have been positive about the proposal pointing to popular bitcoin books as an excellent way to educate newcomers when asked about his writing ability emma rooney pointed out he was recently published in Bitcoin Magazine and nasdaq.com (http://nasdaq.com/). 
I will leave a link in the video description to ammarooni’s medium account where you can read all of this completed Decred work thus far.

And finally we have the Decred arabia communitactions and content creation proposal from arij. The purpose of this proposal is to increase the awareness presence and adoption of Decred inn te arabic region, this will be donde via creating content in arabic, hosting local events and growing social media presence. Leading the proposal is Insaf Nori who has been actively contributing to Decred via translations, content creation and events. Zakaria will  be contributing as a designer. He has made numerous Decred Art wich you can find on twitter. They say blockchain technology today is emerging in the arabic world. The total budget is 6 200 usd dollars lasting six mounths and payable in Decred. User feedback has been positive praising the frugal budget and the hard work demostrated by the proposer.
